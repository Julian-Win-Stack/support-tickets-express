When I ask you to write git commit messages, use this format - 

The Core Rules (Industry Standard)

1. Use the Imperative Mood

Write:

Add audit log for ticket status changes
Fix race condition in job worker
Refactor DB connection to reuse single instance

Not:

Added audit log
Adding audit log
Fixes race condition

Why?

Because Git internally reads it as:

“If applied, this commit will…”

So:
	•	“Add feature”
	•	“Fix bug”
	•	“Remove unused route”

Clean. Direct. No fluff.

⸻

2. Keep the First Line Short (≤ 50 characters ideally)

Short summary line.

Example:

Add background job system for notifications

If you need more explanation, add a body below.

⸻

3. Add a Blank Line Before Body (If Needed)

Structure:

Add background job system for notifications

Implements a jobs table with status and dedupe_key.
Creates worker process to process pending jobs.
Enqueues job when ticket status changes.

This is professional.

Not required for tiny commits, but mandatory for complex ones.

⸻

4. One Commit = One Logical Change

This is where beginners mess up.

Bad:

Add login, fix ticket bug, change CSS, update README

That’s chaos.

Good:

Add session regeneration on login

Separate:

Fix incorrect status filtering for admin

Why this matters:
	•	Makes debugging easier
	•	Makes reverts safer
	•	Makes you look disciplined

Startups love this because production incidents happen.

⸻

5. Be Specific

Bad:

Improve backend

Improve what?

Good:

Optimize DB connection to reuse single SQLite instance

Or:

Make job processing idempotent using dedupe_key

Specific commits show technical clarity.

⸻

Advanced: The Format Real Teams Use

Many startups use Conventional Commits.

Format:

type: short summary

Examples:

feat: add audit logging for ticket updates
fix: prevent duplicate job enqueueing
refactor: extract ticket constraint builder
test: add worker process integration tests
docs: update README with architecture overview

Common types:
	•	feat
	•	fix
	•	refactor
	•	test
	•	docs
	•	chore

Do you HAVE to use this?

No.

But using it signals maturity.


Practical Template For You

Here’s what I’d personally use if I were 19 and trying to look dangerous on GitHub:

Small Change

fix: prevent users from editing closed tickets

Medium Change

feat: enqueue notification job on ticket status change

Adds job row with type 'ticket_status_changed'.
Worker processes job and updates notification table.

Large Change

refactor: migrate backend to TypeScript strict mode

Converts controllers, middleware, and utils to TS.
Adds explicit return types and DB row interfaces.
